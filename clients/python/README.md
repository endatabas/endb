# Endatabas Client and Console

The official Python client library and console for
[Endatabas](https://www.endatabas.com).

## Installation

```sh
pip install endb
pip install websockets
```

`endb` is supported on Python 3.10 and above.
[WebSocket](https://docs.endatabas.com/reference/websocket_api)
support is optional.

## Documentation

* [Python client library](https://docs.endatabas.com/reference/clients)
* [Console](https://docs.endatabas.com/reference/clients)
* [Endb SQL Reference](https://docs.endatabas.com/sql/)

## Usage

```python
from endb import Endb
e = Endb()
e.sql("INSERT INTO users {name: 'Yuvi'}")
e.sql("SELECT * FROM users;")
```

When the `websockets` dependency is installed, it is possible to
return asynchronous results to the Python interactive shell
directly if you start it with `python3 -m asyncio`:

```python
from endb import EndbWebSocket
ews = EndbWebSocket()
result = await ews.sql("SELECT * FROM users;")
print(result)
```
