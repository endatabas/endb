# @endatabas/endb

The official JavaScript client library for
[Endatabas](https://www.endatabas.com/).

## Requirements

* Node.js 14.5.0+ or other JavaScript engine with
  [strong ES2020 support](https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/)

## Install

```sh
npm install @endatabas/endb
npm install ws
```

`@endatabas/endb` has zero dependencies. If you need WebSocket support
under Node.js, you will need to install a WebSocket library manually, as above.
If you are using `@endatabas/endb` in the browser (after bundling),
this is not required.

Please note that there is another (unscoped) packaged named `endb`.
It is not related to the Endatabas project.

## Documentation

* [JavaScript client library](https://docs.endatabas.com/reference/clients#javascript)
* [Endb SQL Reference](https://docs.endatabas.com/sql/)

## Usage

```javascript
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { Endb, EndbWebSocket } from '@endatabas/endb';

var e = new Endb();
await e.sql("insert into users {name: 'Thupil'};");
var result = await e.sql("select * from users;");
console.log(result);

var ews = new EndbWebSocket({ws: WebSocket});
await ews.sql("insert into users {name: 'Lydia'};");
var ws_result = await ews.sql("select * from users;");
console.log(ws_result);
```

## Usage (Web)

If you want to try out Endb from the browser without Node.js
or bundling, you can consume it directly.

Note that this approach is only really useful for quick
experimentation in the browser's JavaScript console, not
production usage.
Without a proxy, it's most likely that only `EndbWebSocket`
will work without CORS errors, as the `Endb` class relies on HTTP.

```javascript
// endb_sample.mjs
import { Endb, EndbWebSocket } from 'path/to/node_modules/@endatabas/endb/endb.mjs';
window.Endb = Endb;
window.EndbWebSocket = EndbWebSocket;
```

```html
<!-- endb_sample.html -->
<html>
  <head><script type="module" src="endb_sample.mjs"></script></head>
  <body><h1>Endb Sample</h1></body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// in the endb_sample.html JavaScript console:
var ews = new window.EndbWebSocket();
ews.sql(`select * from ${table}`, {table: 'users'});
```
